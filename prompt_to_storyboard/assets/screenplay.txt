EXT. FOREST PATH - MORNING

Sunlight streams through the canopy onto a forest path dappled with shadows and patches of wildflowers. Birds sing. The air buzzes with anticipation as animals gather along the sides of the path—foxes, badgers, mice.

At the starting line, JUMPY the rabbit and LUMBER the tortoise stand side by side. Jumpy, lean and silver in the fur but vibrantly alert, gives Lumber a friendly nod.

JUMPY
May the best racer win, my friend. But let's give them a show!

Lumber, ancient and steadfast, grins as much as a tortoise can.

LUMBER
As long as we cross in good spirits, that's victory enough for me.

A BADGER with a striped tail—acting as the officiator—raises a leaf and waves it.

BADGER
On your marks… Get set… GO!

They’re off! This time, Jumpy sprints forward, ears flattened with concentration. The crowd of animals cheers. Lumber plods forward, steady but not slow—a determined rhythm in every step.

EXT. FOREST PATH - LATER

Jumpy is a blur, dashing past bending ferns and bright mushrooms. He glances back, seeing LUMBER far behind but making progress.

JUMPY (V.O.)
This time, I’m in it to the end. No slacking, just focus.

Jumpy surges ahead, bounding over fallen logs.

Suddenly, the earth trembles. A deep RUMBLE shakes the path.

Jumpy skids to a stop, ears high, nose twitching. The spectators scatter, shrieking and seeking cover. A crack splits the path behind him—right where LUMBER is crawling.

LUMBER
Whoooa!

A tree lurches, starting to topple toward the path. Lumber freezes, shell scraping as the ground fractures around him.

Jumpy spins. He looks at the finish line—just visible through the trees—and then at his old friend, in danger.

He doesn't hesitate. Jumpy bounds back toward Lumber, racing the falling tree. Dirt bursts beneath his paws as he leaps between falling branches.

JUMPY
Hold on, Lumber!

Jumpy reaches Lumber, shoves against the tortoise’s shell with all his might. Together, they slide just out of reach as the huge tree crashes down, blocking the path behind them with a heavy THUD. The ground quakes again—a brief aftershock.

The two old friends gasp for breath.

LUMBER
Heh. Not the usual obstacle, eh?

JUMPY
(winded, smiling)
No, but it makes for a memorable race.

Cheers pick up again from the animals as the danger passes. Jumpy offers a paw. Lumber, tired but unhurt, places a flipper in Jumpy’s paw.

They proceed, together—Jumpy setting a gentle pace beside his slow, steadfast friend.

EXT. FINISH LINE - FOREST PATH - LATER

All the animals cheer as Jumpy and Lumber pass the finish together, side by side, Jumpy’s paw on Lumber’s shell.

BADGER
Here they are! Together!

The crowd erupts. Foxes toss flower petals. Birds chirp a merry song.

Jumpy and Lumber share a smile, surrounded by their cheering friends.

LUMBER
(sincerely)
This is the win I always wanted.

JUMPY
Me too.

The earth has stilled, the forest safe, and their friendship unshaken.

                                        FADE OUT.

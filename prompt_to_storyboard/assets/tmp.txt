Draw a pencil sketch storyboard image with the following prompt:
```
Jumpy and Lumber cross the finish line together, both smiling warmly, with Jumpy gently holding Lumberâ€™s shell. All around them, the forest animals cheer and celebrate, confetti of flowers falling through the air in the sunlit clearing.
```

When drawing the sketch, use the following as background information:
```
Characters:
- Jumpy: A well-aged but still sprightly rabbit who use to have a tendency to slack off whenever the opportunity arose. He is now a wise old rabbit who has learned the value of hard work and responsibility.
- Lumber: An ancient tortoise who has always been a hard and diligent worker. He is now a wise old tortoise who has learned the value of taking breaks and enjoying life.

Location:
The forest: A lush and vibrant forest filled with trees, flowers, and wildlife. It is a place of beauty and tranquility. A path runs through the forest that the forest animals use for impromptu races
```

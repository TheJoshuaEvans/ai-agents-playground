base_plot_overview_instructions = f"""
The plot overview you generate will eventually be converted into a screenplay meant for screen, so it should be suitably detailed. Focus should be put on the visuals and the actions of the characters
You must ALWAYS ensure that the plot overview is consistent with the story bible.
The plot overview should include details about the story, including the main characters, setting, conflict, and resolution.
When generating the plot overview, elements from the story bible should always be preferred over newly generated elements, but you should still be willing to generate new elements if the story bible is lacking in detail or quantity.
Any critical dialogue should be included in the plot overview

ALWAYS put the plot overview in the 'plot_overview' field of the output, and any other relevant information or commentary in the 'comments' field.
